# Good to know

## How does it work?

The styla connect module is based on the magento rest api and extends it for our use case.
The rest api is used to retrieve your product data for the styla magazine editor.

We also do provide an ajax endpoint to retrieve the product details like stock information's and product options. 

## Database

None, this module does not create any new table or new database fields.

## Custom searches

If you do use a custom search their is most likely some programing work to do.
We did our best to make it work with search modules that work as a drop in replacement with the 
magento search.


## Magento rewrites/overwrites

None

## Magento product types

Currently this module does only work with simples and configs. Also custom options are not yet supported.

## Module conflicts

None so far
