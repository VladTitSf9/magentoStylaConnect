Requires:
* PHP >= 5.3. Since Magento 1 itself does not run on PHP7, we haven't tested on this PHP version.
* Magento 1.7 or later, for our Magento 2 plugin check this https://github.com/styladev/magentoStylaConnect
* Magento REST API activated to share product information http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/m1x/api/rest/introduction.html

Styla Connect is a module to connect your Magento Store with [Styla](http://www.styla.com/). The first diagram on [this page](https://styladocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CO/pages/9961481/Technical+Integration) should provide you an overview of what the plugin does and how it exchanges data with Styla.
